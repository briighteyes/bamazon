BAMAZON is a command link node application linked to a mysql database currently contaning a list of products. 

***By running "bamazonCustomer" in the terminal the 'customer' has the ability to view products in inventory and choose one or more to purchase. 

***By running "bamazonManager" in the terminal the 'manager' has four options.
    1. View the inventory
    2. View inventory with products below 5 units
    3. Add more units to an existing product
    4. Add a new product to the inventory
